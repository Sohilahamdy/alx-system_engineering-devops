# Distributed Web Infrastructure

## Design Diagram

![Distributed Web Infrastructure](path/to/your/diagram_image.png)

## Components and Explanation

1. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**
   - **Reason for adding**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, enhancing performance and reliability.
   - **Distribution Algorithm**: Can be configured with different algorithms, such as Round Robin or Least Connections.
   - **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive**:
     - **Active-Active**: Both servers actively handle traffic.
     - **Active-Passive**: One server is active, and the other is on standby.

2. **Web Server (Nginx)**
   - **Reason for adding**: Serves static content and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.
   - **Explanation**: Efficient in handling multiple concurrent connections.

3. **Application Server**
   - **Reason for adding**: Runs the application code and handles the business logic of the website.
   - **Explanation**: Processes dynamic requests and interacts with the database.

4. **Database (MySQL)**
   - **Reason for adding**: Stores and manages all the data for the website.
   - **Primary-Replica Cluster**:
     - **Primary Node**: Handles all write operations.
     - **Replica Node**: Copies data from the primary node and handles read-only operations.
   - **Difference for the Application**: Writes to the primary node, reads from both primary and replica nodes.

## Issues with the Infrastructure

1. **Single Points of Failure (SPOF)**
   - Load balancer and database can be SPOF.

2. **Security Issues**
   - No firewall, no HTTPS.

3. **No Monitoring**
   - Lack of real-time monitoring tools.
