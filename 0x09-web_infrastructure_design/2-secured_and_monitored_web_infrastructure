# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

## Design Diagram

## Components and Explanation

1. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**
   - **Reason for adding**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
   - **Distribution Algorithm**: Can be configured with Round Robin or Least Connections.
   - **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive**:
     - **Active-Active**: Both servers actively handle traffic.
     - **Active-Passive**: One server is active, and the other is on standby.

2. **Firewalls**
   - **Reason for adding**: Provides security by controlling network traffic.
   - **Explanation**: Protects web, application, and database servers from unauthorized access.

3. **SSL Certificate**
   - **Reason for adding**: Ensures secure, encrypted traffic.
   - **Explanation**: Enables HTTPS for secure communication between users and servers.

4. **Monitoring Clients (Sumologic or other)**
   - **Reason for adding**: Collects and analyzes performance data.
   - **Explanation**: Sends data to a monitoring service to track server performance.
   - **Monitoring Web Server QPS**: Configured to track and alert on queries per second.

## Issues with the Infrastructure

1. **Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level**
   - **Issue**: Traffic between the load balancer and backend servers is not encrypted.
   - **Solution**: Use end-to-end encryption.

2. **Single MySQL Server for Writes**
   - **Issue**: Creates a single point of failure and performance bottleneck.
   - **Solution**: Implement a Primary-Replica setup for MySQL.

3. **Homogeneous Servers**
   - **Issue**: Resource contention and complicated scaling.
   - **Solution**: Separate roles for web, application, and database servers.
