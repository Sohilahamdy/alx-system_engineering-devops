# Scale Up Web Infrastructure

## Design Diagram

![Scale Up Web Infrastructure](path/to/your/diagram_image.png)

## Components and Explanation

1. **Additional Server**
   - **Reason for adding**: Increases capacity and provides redundancy.

2. **Load Balancer (HAproxy) Cluster**
   - **Reason for adding**: Ensures high availability and reliability.
   - **Explanation**: Configured as a cluster to work together, distributing traffic to the web servers.

3. **Split Components**
   - **Web Server (Nginx)**
     - **Reason for splitting**: Improves performance and manageability.
   - **Application Server**
     - **Reason for splitting**: Handles business logic separately.
   - **Database Server (MySQL)**
     - **Reason for splitting**: Improves data management and performance.

## Specifics of the Infrastructure

1. **Additional Server and Split Components**
   - **Web Server**: Handles HTTP requests and serves static content.
   - **Application Server**: Processes dynamic content and business logic.
   - **Database Server**: Manages data storage and retrieval.

2. **Load Balancer Configuration**
   - **Cluster Setup**: Ensures redundancy and fault tolerance.
   - **Distribution Algorithm**: Round Robin or Least Connections.

## Issues with the Infrastructure

1. **Single Points of Failure (SPOF)**
   - **Issue**: Ensure all components have redundancy.
   - **Solution**: Implement failover strategies.

2. **Security Issues**
   - **Issue**: Ensure firewalls, SSL certificates, and other security measures are in place.
   - **Solution**: Enforce security best practices.

3. **No Monitoring**
   - **Issue**: Lack of monitoring can lead to undetected issues.
   - **Solution**: Implement monitoring clients and alerting mechanisms.
