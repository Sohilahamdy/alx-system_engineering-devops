#### Infrastructure Components:

- **Server:**
  - A computer that provides services to users over the network. It can be a physical or virtual server.
  
- **Domain Name:**
  - A name assigned to a website that users can use to access the site instead of using an IP address.
  
- **DNS Record Type www:**
  - A type of DNS record that points the subdomain www to the server's IP address.

- **Role of the Web Server (Nginx):**
  - Receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from users and serves them the requested pages.

- **Role of the Application Server:**
  - Runs the code and applications required to generate dynamic content for the website.

- **Role of Application Files:**
  - Contains the code and files necessary to run the application.

- **Role of the Database (MySQL):**
  - Stores the data and information needed to run the website and provides it upon request.

- **Communication between the Server and the User's Computer:**
  - Communication occurs via HTTP/HTTPS protocols, where the user sends requests and receives responses from the server.

### Infrastructure Issues

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
  - If the server fails, the entire website will go down because there is no other server to provide the service.

- **Downtime during Maintenance:**
  - When server maintenance or code updates are needed, the website will be unavailable during the maintenance period.

- **Scalability Issues:**
  - If the number of visitors increases significantly, the server may not handle the load, leading to slow responses or even website downtime.
